## API Overview

The KnowledgeOps Agent provides a comprehensive RESTful API that enables programmatic access to all system functionality, supporting integration with existing enterprise systems, custom applications, and automation workflows. The API is designed following OpenAPI 3.0 specifications [1], ensuring standardized documentation, client generation capabilities, and consistent interface patterns across all endpoints.

The API architecture follows REST principles with resource-based URLs, standard HTTP methods, and meaningful HTTP status codes. All API responses use JSON format with consistent structure and error handling patterns. The API supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations, with long-running operations providing status tracking and result retrieval mechanisms.

Version management ensures backward compatibility while enabling system evolution and feature enhancement. The API uses semantic versioning with major version numbers included in the URL path, allowing clients to specify their required API version explicitly. Deprecation policies provide advance notice of changes with migration guidance and support for legacy versions during transition periods.

Content negotiation capabilities support multiple response formats including JSON for programmatic access, XML for legacy system integration, and custom formats for specialized use cases. Request and response compression reduces bandwidth usage and improves performance for large data transfers, particularly important for bulk operations and document content retrieval.

### Base URL and Versioning

The API base URL follows the pattern `https://api.knowledgeops.example.com/v1/` where the version number enables explicit version selection and future compatibility management. All API endpoints are relative to this base URL, providing a consistent namespace for all operations.

Version negotiation supports both URL-based versioning for explicit version selection and header-based versioning for dynamic version selection. The `Accept-Version` header allows clients to specify their preferred API version, with the server responding with the actual version used in the `API-Version` response header.

Backward compatibility policies ensure that minor version updates do not break existing clients, while major version updates provide migration paths and extended support periods for legacy versions. API deprecation follows a structured timeline with advance notification, migration guidance, and gradual feature removal to minimize disruption to existing integrations.

### Request and Response Format

All API requests and responses use JSON format with UTF-8 encoding, ensuring consistent data representation and international character support. Request bodies must include the `Content-Type: application/json` header, while responses include appropriate content type headers and character encoding specifications.

Standardized response envelope format provides consistent structure across all endpoints, including success indicators, data payloads, metadata, and error information. The response envelope includes pagination information for list operations, timing information for performance monitoring, and request identifiers for debugging and support purposes.

Field naming conventions use camelCase for consistency with JavaScript and modern API practices, while maintaining clear, descriptive names that convey meaning without requiring extensive documentation. Optional fields are clearly documented with default values and behavior specifications.

Date and time formatting follows ISO 8601 standards with UTC timezone specification, ensuring consistent temporal data representation across different client environments and geographic regions. Numeric precision is specified for financial and measurement data to prevent rounding errors and ensure accurate calculations.

## Authentication

The KnowledgeOps Agent API implements comprehensive authentication and authorization mechanisms that integrate with enterprise identity systems while providing secure access control for all API operations. The authentication system supports multiple protocols and token types to accommodate diverse integration requirements and security policies.

### OAuth 2.0 Integration

OAuth 2.0 serves as the primary authentication mechanism for the KnowledgeOps Agent API, providing secure, standardized access control that integrates seamlessly with enterprise identity providers and supports various client types including web applications, mobile apps, and server-to-server integrations [2].

The authorization code flow provides the most secure authentication method for interactive applications, requiring user consent and providing short-lived access tokens with refresh capabilities. This flow begins with redirecting users to the authorization server, where they authenticate and grant permissions to the client application. Upon successful authentication, the authorization server returns an authorization code that the client exchanges for access and refresh tokens.

Client credentials flow enables server-to-server authentication for automated systems and background processes that operate without user interaction. This flow requires client applications to authenticate using their client ID and secret, receiving access tokens that represent the application's identity rather than a specific user. Client credentials flow is ideal for system integrations, batch processing, and monitoring applications.

Token management includes automatic token refresh mechanisms that maintain session continuity without requiring user re-authentication. Refresh tokens have longer lifespans than access tokens and can be used to obtain new access tokens when the current token expires. Token revocation capabilities enable immediate access termination for security incidents or user account changes.

Scope-based authorization provides fine-grained access control by limiting token permissions to specific API operations and data types. Scopes are defined hierarchically, allowing broad permissions like `read` or `write` as well as specific permissions like `documents:read` or `analytics:write`. Applications request specific scopes during authentication, and users can review and approve the requested permissions.

### API Key Authentication

API key authentication provides a simpler alternative to OAuth 2.0 for certain use cases, particularly for internal systems, development environments, and legacy integrations that cannot easily implement OAuth flows. API keys offer straightforward authentication with minimal implementation complexity while maintaining security through proper key management practices.

API key generation and management occur through the administrative interface or management API, allowing administrators to create, rotate, and revoke keys as needed. Each API key includes metadata such as creation date, last usage, associated user or system, and permission scope. Key rotation policies ensure regular key updates to maintain security while providing transition periods for client updates.

Key-based rate limiting and monitoring provide additional security controls by tracking usage patterns and detecting potential abuse or compromise. Unusual usage patterns, such as requests from unexpected geographic locations or excessive request rates, trigger alerts and can result in automatic key suspension pending investigation.

Scope limitation for API keys mirrors OAuth scope functionality, allowing keys to be restricted to specific API operations and data types. This principle of least privilege ensures that compromised keys have limited impact and that systems have access only to the functionality they require for their intended purpose.

### Enterprise SSO Integration

Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) integration enables seamless authentication using existing organizational identity systems, reducing password fatigue and improving security through centralized identity management. The KnowledgeOps Agent supports multiple SSO protocols and identity providers to accommodate diverse enterprise environments.

SAML 2.0 integration provides robust SSO capabilities with enterprise identity providers such as Active Directory Federation Services, Okta, Ping Identity, and other SAML-compliant systems [3]. SAML integration includes support for encrypted assertions, digital signatures, and complex attribute mappings that enable rich user profile information and role-based access control.

OpenID Connect integration offers modern SSO capabilities with cloud identity providers such as Azure Active Directory, Google Workspace, and other OpenID Connect providers. OpenID Connect builds on OAuth 2.0 to provide standardized identity information and user profile data, enabling personalized experiences and role-based access control.

Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning automatically creates and updates user accounts based on information from SSO providers, eliminating manual user management overhead while ensuring that user information remains current. JIT provisioning includes automatic role assignment based on group memberships, department information, and other attributes provided by the identity provider.

  },
  "metadata": {
    "webhook_id": "webhook_1718380800_abc123",
    "delivery_attempt": 1,
    "signature": "sha256=abc123def456..."
  }
}
```

#### Query Events

Query events provide information about user queries and system responses, enabling analytics and integration with external systems.

**Event: query.completed**

```json
{
  "event_id": "event_1718380800_002",
  "event_type": "query.completed",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-14T14:45:00Z",
  "data": {
    "query": {
      "id": "q_1718380800_abc123",
      "text": "How do I implement retry logic in QLAB02?",

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Webhook Security

Webhook security mechanisms ensure that webhook deliveries are authentic and secure, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring data integrity during transmission.

#### Signature Verification

All webhook deliveries include cryptographic signatures that enable verification of payload authenticity and integrity.

```python
import hmac
import hashlib

def verify_webhook_signature(payload, signature, secret):
    """Verify webhook signature"""
    expected_signature = hmac.new(
        secret.encode('utf-8'),
        payload.encode('utf-8'),
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()
    
    return hmac.compare_digest(
        f"sha256={expected_signature}",
        signature
    )
```

#### Retry and Delivery Guarantees

The webhook system implements robust delivery mechanisms with retry logic, exponential backoff, and delivery status tracking to ensure reliable event delivery even when receiving systems experience temporary issues.

Delivery attempts include configurable retry policies with exponential backoff, maximum retry limits, and dead letter queues for failed deliveries. Webhook delivery status is tracked and made available through the monitoring API for operational visibility and troubleshooting.

## Error Handling

The KnowledgeOps Agent API implements comprehensive error handling that provides clear, actionable error information while maintaining security and system stability. Error responses follow consistent patterns and include sufficient detail for debugging and resolution.

### Error Response Format

All API errors use a standardized response format that includes error codes, messages, and contextual information to help clients understand and resolve issues.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_QUERY_SYNTAX",
    "message": "The query contains invalid syntax or unsupported operators",
    "details": {
      "field": "query",
      "invalid_syntax": "AND OR NOT",
      "suggestion": "Use simple natural language instead of boolean operators"
    },
    "request_id": "req_1718380800_abc123",
    "timestamp": "2025-06-14T14:45:00Z",
    "documentation_url": "https://docs.knowledgeops.com/api/errors#invalid-query-syntax"
  }
}
```

### HTTP Status Codes

The API uses standard HTTP status codes with specific meanings and consistent usage patterns across all endpoints.

| Status Code | Meaning | Usage |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| 200 | OK | Successful request with response body |
| 201 | Created | Resource successfully created |
| 204 | No Content | Successful request with no response body |
| 400 | Bad Request | Invalid request syntax or parameters |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Authentication required or invalid |
| 403 | Forbidden | Insufficient permissions for requested operation |
| 404 | Not Found | Requested resource does not exist |
| 409 | Conflict | Request conflicts with current resource state |
| 422 | Unprocessable Entity | Valid syntax but semantic errors |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | Unexpected server error |
| 502 | Bad Gateway | External service unavailable |
| 503 | Service Unavailable | System maintenance or overload |

### Common Error Scenarios

#### Authentication Errors

Authentication errors occur when requests lack valid authentication credentials or when credentials have expired or been revoked.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_TOKEN",
    "message": "The provided authentication token is invalid or expired",
    "details": {
      "token_type": "bearer",
      "expiry": "2025-06-14T13:30:00Z",
      "suggestion": "Refresh your token or re-authenticate"
    },
    "request_id": "req_1718380800_def456"
  }
}
```

#### Validation Errors

Validation errors provide detailed information about invalid request parameters or data format issues.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "One or more request parameters are invalid",
    "details": {
      "validation_errors": [
        {
          "field": "max_results",
          "value": 150,
          "constraint": "maximum value is 100",
          "message": "max_results must be between 1 and 100"
        },
        {
          "field": "date_range.start",
          "value": "invalid-date",
          "constraint": "ISO 8601 format required",
          "message": "date_range.start must be a valid ISO 8601 date"
        }
      ]
    },
    "request_id": "req_1718380800_ghi789"
  }
}
```

#### Rate Limiting Errors

Rate limiting errors include information about current limits and when requests can be retried.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
    "message": "Request rate limit exceeded",
    "details": {
      "limit": 100,
      "window_seconds": 60,
      "retry_after_seconds": 45,
      "current_usage": 101
    },
    "request_id": "req_1718380800_jkl012"
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting

The KnowledgeOps Agent API implements comprehensive rate limiting to ensure fair resource allocation, prevent abuse, and maintain system stability under varying load conditions. Rate limiting policies are configurable and can be customized based on user roles, API endpoints, and organizational requirements.

### Rate Limiting Policies

Rate limiting is implemented at multiple levels with different policies for different types of operations and user categories.

#### User-Based Rate Limits

Individual users are subject to rate limits based on their subscription level, role, and usage patterns.

| User Type | Requests per Minute | Burst Limit | Daily Limit |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Free Tier | 10 | 20 | 500 |
| Standard | 60 | 120 | 5,000 |
| Premium | 100 | 200 | 10,000 |
| Enterprise | 200 | 400 | 50,000 |
| Admin | 500 | 1,000 | Unlimited |

#### Endpoint-Specific Limits

Different API endpoints have specific rate limits based on their computational cost and resource requirements.

| Endpoint Category | Rate Limit | Reasoning |
|------------------|------------|-----------|
| Query Operations | Standard user limit | Primary functionality |
| Document Retrieval | 2x standard limit | Lightweight operations |
| Analytics | 0.5x standard limit | Resource-intensive |
| Configuration | 10 requests/hour | Administrative operations |
| Bulk Operations | 5 requests/hour | High resource usage |

### Rate Limit Headers

All API responses include rate limiting information in HTTP headers to help clients manage their request patterns and avoid rate limit violations.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 87
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1718381400
X-RateLimit-Window: 60
Retry-After: 45
```

### Rate Limit Handling

Clients should implement appropriate rate limit handling to ensure reliable operation and optimal user experience.

#### Exponential Backoff

When rate limits are exceeded, clients should implement exponential backoff with jitter to avoid thundering herd problems.

```python
import time
import random

def api_request_with_backoff(url, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        response = make_request(url)
        
        if response.status_code == 429:
            retry_after = int(response.headers.get('Retry-After', 60))
            jitter = random.uniform(0.1, 0.5)
            sleep_time = (2 ** attempt) + retry_after + jitter
            time.sleep(sleep_time)
            continue
            
        return response
    
    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```
