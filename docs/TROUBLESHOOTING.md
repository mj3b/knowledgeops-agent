## Introduction

This Troubleshooting Guide is designed to help users and administrators diagnose and resolve common issues encountered while installing, configuring, and operating the KnowledgeOps Agent. It provides structured approaches to problem-solving, common error explanations, and steps to gather necessary information for support.

Effective troubleshooting involves a systematic approach: understanding the problem, gathering information, identifying potential causes, testing hypotheses, and implementing solutions. This guide aims to equip you with the knowledge to tackle most common challenges.

Before diving into specific issues, always ensure you have consulted the relevant sections of the [Installation Guide](./INSTALLATION.md), [Configuration Guide](./CONFIGURATION.md), and [API Documentation](./API.md).

## General Troubleshooting Steps

When encountering any issue, follow these general steps first:

1.  **Clearly Define the Problem:**
    *   What are the symptoms? (e.g., error message, slow performance, incorrect results)
    *   When did the problem start? Was it after a specific change (e.g., configuration update, new integration)?
    *   Is the problem consistent or intermittent?
    *   Can you reproduce the problem reliably? If so, what are the steps?
    *   What is the expected behavior versus the actual behavior?
    *   What is the scope of the impact? (e.g., single user, specific feature, entire system)

2.  **Check Logs:**
    *   Application logs (default: `/var/log/knowledgeops/app.log` or console output, see [Configuration Guide](./CONFIGURATION.md#logging-and-monitoring-configuration)).
    *   Audit logs (default: `/var/log/knowledgeops/audit.log`).
    *   System logs (`syslog`, `journalctl` on Linux).
    *   Logs from dependent services (database, Redis, message queue, Confluence, SharePoint).
    *   Look for error messages, warnings, stack traces, or unusual patterns around the time the issue occurred.
    *   Increase log verbosity temporarily if needed (e.g., set `KNOWLEDGEOPS_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`).

3.  **Verify Configuration:**
    *   Double-check relevant sections in `config.yaml` and environment variables.
    *   Ensure there are no typos or incorrect formatting in YAML.
    *   Verify that environment variables for secrets (API keys, passwords) are correctly set and accessible by the application process.
    *   Confirm that the application loaded the intended configuration (check startup logs).

4.  **Check System Resources:**
    *   **CPU Usage:** Is the CPU consistently high? Use `top`, `htop`.
    *   **Memory Usage:** Is the system running out of memory? Check for OOM killer messages in system logs. Use `free -m`, `vmstat`.
    *   **Disk Space:** Is there sufficient disk space, especially for logs, databases, and temporary files? Use `df -h`.
    *   **Network Connectivity:** Can the KnowledgeOps Agent server reach its dependencies (databases, external APIs)? Use `ping`, `curl`, `telnet`, `nslookup`.

5.  **Check Dependent Services:**
    *   **Database:** Is the database server running and accessible? Are connection pools exhausted?
    *   **Cache (Redis):** Is Redis running and accessible?
    *   **Message Queue:** Is the message broker running and accessible?
    *   **External Integrations (Confluence, SharePoint, LLM Provider):** Are these services operational? Check their status pages or logs. Can the KnowledgeOps server reach them?

6.  **Restart Services (Cautiously):**
    *   Sometimes, a simple restart of the KnowledgeOps Agent application or a dependent service can resolve transient issues. Do this cautiously in production and try to understand the root cause if a restart helps.

7.  **Isolate the Issue:**
    *   If multiple components are involved, try to isolate which one is causing the problem. For example, if search is failing, is it the query parsing, the connection to the vector DB, or the LLM response generation?

8.  **Check for Recent Changes:**
    *   Were there any recent code deployments, configuration changes, system updates, or network modifications? These are common triggers for new issues.

9.  **Consult Documentation:**
    *   Review this guide, the specific component documentation (e.g., Confluence integration), and any relevant third-party documentation.

## Installation and Setup Issues

### Problem: Python Dependency Conflicts

*   **Symptoms:** Errors during `pip install -r requirements.txt` mentioning incompatible package versions.
*   **Causes:** Conflicting version requirements between packages; outdated `pip` or `setuptools`.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Use a Virtual Environment:** Always install dependencies in a Python virtual environment (`python -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate`).
    2.  **Upgrade Pip and Setuptools:** `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools`.
    3.  **Resolve Conflicts:** Examine the error messages. You might need to:
        *   Pin a specific version of a problematic package in `requirements.txt` (e.g., `somepackage==1.2.3`).
        *   Use `pipdeptree` to understand the dependency tree and identify the source of the conflict.
        *   Try installing packages one by one or in smaller groups to isolate the issue.
    4.  **Clean Install:** Remove the virtual environment and `pip cache clean`, then try reinstalling.

### Problem: Application Fails to Start

*   **Symptoms:** The application process exits immediately after starting, or the HTTP server doesn't bind to the port.
*   **Causes:** Missing critical configuration; invalid configuration syntax; port already in use; insufficient permissions; missing essential files.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Check Startup Logs:** Look for error messages right at the beginning of the application log. Increase log level to `DEBUG` if necessary.
    2.  **Validate Configuration:** Ensure `config.yaml` is valid YAML and all required environment variables (especially `KNOWLEDGEOPS_SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`) are set.
    3.  **Check Port Availability:** Use `netstat -tulnp | grep <PORT>` (Linux) or `lsof -i :<PORT>` (macOS) to see if `KNOWLEDGEOPS_PORT` is already in use. If so, change the port or stop the conflicting service.
    4.  **Permissions:** Ensure the user running the application has permissions to read configuration files, write logs, and bind to the specified port (ports below 1024 usually require root).
    5.  **File Paths:** Verify all file paths in the configuration (log files, template directories) are correct and accessible.

### Problem: Docker Container Fails to Build or Run

*   **Symptoms:** `docker build` fails; `docker-compose up` shows errors and containers exit.
*   **Causes:** Errors in `Dockerfile` (e.g., missing files, incorrect commands); issues with base image; resource limits on the Docker host; incorrect volume mounts or port mappings in `docker-compose.yml`.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Examine Build Logs:** Carefully read the output of `docker build` for specific error messages.
    2.  **Check Dockerfile:** Ensure all `COPY` or `ADD` commands reference existing files. Verify base image exists and is accessible. Check command syntax.
    3.  **Check `docker-compose.yml`:** Verify service definitions, volume mounts (paths must be correct on the host and container), port mappings, and environment variable settings.
    4.  **Container Logs:** If containers start then exit, check their logs: `docker logs <container_name_or_id>`.
    5.  **Resource Limits:** Ensure your Docker host has enough CPU, memory, and disk space.
    6.  **Network Configuration:** If containers need to communicate with each other or external services, ensure Docker networking is correctly configured.

## Configuration Problems

### Problem: Application Uses Default Settings Instead of `config.yaml`

*   **Symptoms:** Changes made in `config.yaml` are not reflected in application behavior.
*   **Causes:** Application is not loading the correct `config.yaml` file; environment variables are overriding `config.yaml` settings.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Verify `KNOWLEDGEOPS_CONFIG_PATH`:** If you use this environment variable, ensure it points to the correct path of your `config.yaml`.
    2.  **Check Default Path:** If `KNOWLEDGEOPS_CONFIG_PATH` is not set, ensure `config.yaml` is in the application's root working directory.
    3.  **Startup Logs:** Check application startup logs. It should indicate which configuration file is being loaded.
    4.  **Environment Variable Overrides:** Remember that environment variables take precedence. Check if any relevant environment variables are set that might be overriding your `config.yaml` values.
    5.  **YAML Syntax:** Ensure `config.yaml` has valid YAML syntax. Use a YAML linter.

### Problem: Incorrect Behavior Due to Misconfiguration

*   **Symptoms:** Features not working as expected; errors related to specific components (e.g., AI models, integrations).
*   **Causes:** Typos in configuration values; incorrect data types; misunderstanding of a configuration option.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Consult [Configuration Guide](./CONFIGURATION.md):** Carefully review the documentation for the relevant configuration section.
    2.  **Validate Data Types:** Ensure values match the expected types (e.g., boolean `true`/`false` vs string `"true"`/`"false"`, integers, lists).
    3.  **Check Enum Values:** For options with predefined choices (e.g., `llm_provider.name`), ensure you're using a valid value.
    4.  **File Paths and URLs:** Double-check all file paths and URLs for correctness and accessibility from the application server.
    5.  **Test Incrementally:** If unsure, make small configuration changes one at a time and test to see the effect.

## Authentication and Authorization Errors

### Problem: Users Cannot Log In (Web UI or API)

*   **Symptoms:** Login attempts fail with 


authentication errors; API returns 401 Unauthorized.
*   **Causes:** Incorrect credentials; authentication service (SSO, OAuth provider) is down; misconfigured authentication settings; expired tokens.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Check Credentials:** Verify username/password or API key is correct.
    2.  **SSO Configuration:** If using SSO (SAML/OIDC), check:
        *   SSO provider is operational.
        *   Configuration in `config.yaml` under `security.authentication.sso` matches the SSO provider settings.
        *   Certificate or metadata files are correct and accessible.
        *   Clock synchronization between KnowledgeOps server and SSO provider (important for SAML).
    3.  **OAuth2 Configuration:** If using OAuth2:
        *   Client ID and secret are correct.
        *   Redirect URIs match exactly (including protocol, domain, port, path).
        *   Scopes are correctly configured.
    4.  **JWT Configuration:** If using JWT tokens:
        *   `KNOWLEDGEOPS_JWT_SECRET_KEY` is set and consistent across all application instances.
        *   Token hasn't expired. Check `access_token_expire_minutes` in configuration.
    5.  **Logs:** Check authentication-related logs for specific error messages.

### Problem: Users Get "Access Denied" or 403 Forbidden Errors

*   **Symptoms:** Users can authenticate but cannot access certain features or documents.
*   **Causes:** Insufficient permissions; role-based access control (RBAC) misconfiguration; source system permissions not properly enforced.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Check User Roles:** Verify the user's role and associated permissions in the system. See `security.authorization.roles` in configuration.
    2.  **Source Permissions:** If `security.authorization.enforce_source_permissions` is enabled, ensure the user has appropriate permissions in the source system (Confluence, SharePoint).
    3.  **Integration Permissions:** Check if the integration service account has sufficient permissions to access the content on behalf of users.
    4.  **Audit Logs:** Review audit logs to see what permissions were checked and why access was denied.

### Problem: API Key Authentication Fails

*   **Symptoms:** API requests with API keys return 401 Unauthorized.
*   **Causes:** Invalid API key; API key expired or revoked; incorrect API key format in request headers.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Verify API Key:** Ensure the API key is correct and hasn't been revoked.
    2.  **Header Format:** Check that the API key is included in the correct header format: `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>`.
    3.  **API Key Scope:** Ensure the API key has the necessary scopes/permissions for the requested operation.
    4.  **Rate Limiting:** Check if the API key has hit rate limits.

## Integration Issues (Confluence, SharePoint, etc.)

### Problem: Confluence Integration Fails to Connect

*   **Symptoms:** Sync jobs fail; error messages about Confluence connection; no documents from Confluence appear in search results.
*   **Causes:** Incorrect Confluence URL; invalid API token; network connectivity issues; Confluence server is down; insufficient permissions.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Verify Confluence URL:** Ensure `base_url` in the Confluence integration configuration is correct and accessible from the KnowledgeOps server.
    2.  **Test API Token:** Use `curl` to test the Confluence API directly:
        ```bash
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
             -H "Accept: application/json" \
             "https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/space"
        ```
        This should return a list of spaces if the token is valid.
    3.  **Check Permissions:** Ensure the user associated with the API token has read access to the spaces you want to sync.
    4.  **Network Connectivity:** From the KnowledgeOps server, test connectivity to Confluence:
        ```bash
        curl -I https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/wiki
        ```
    5.  **Confluence Status:** Check if Confluence is experiencing issues by visiting the Atlassian Status page or your organization's Confluence instance directly.
    6.  **Logs:** Check integration-specific logs for detailed error messages.

### Problem: SharePoint Integration Fails to Connect

*   **Symptoms:** SharePoint sync jobs fail; error messages about SharePoint connection; no SharePoint documents in search results.
*   **Causes:** Incorrect tenant ID or site URL; invalid client credentials; insufficient permissions; Microsoft Graph API issues.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Verify SharePoint Configuration:** Double-check `tenant_id` and `site_url` in the SharePoint integration configuration.
    2.  **Test Client Credentials:** Use a tool like Postman or `curl` to test OAuth2 authentication with Microsoft Graph:
        ```bash
        curl -X POST "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>/oauth2/v2.0/token" \
             -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
             -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&client_secret=<CLIENT_SECRET>&scope=https://graph.microsoft.com/.default"
        ```
        This should return an access token if credentials are valid.
    3.  **Check Permissions:** Ensure the Azure AD application has the necessary permissions (e.g., `Sites.Read.All`, `Files.Read.All`) and that admin consent has been granted.
    4.  **Test Graph API Access:** With a valid access token, test access to the SharePoint site:
        ```bash
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
             "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/<SITE_ID>"
        ```
    5.  **Microsoft Graph Status:** Check the Microsoft 365 Service Health Dashboard for any ongoing issues with SharePoint or Microsoft Graph.

### Problem: Partial Data Synchronization

*   **Symptoms:** Only some documents from Confluence/SharePoint are synchronized; sync completes but with fewer documents than expected.
*   **Causes:** Permission restrictions; content filters excluding documents; API rate limiting; large documents causing timeouts.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Check Sync Filters:** Review `sync_settings` in the integration configuration. Ensure `spaces_to_sync`, `content_types_to_sync`, `file_types_to_sync`, etc., are not overly restrictive.
    2.  **Permission Audit:** Verify that the integration service account has access to all the content you expect to sync.
    3.  **Rate Limiting:** Check if the integration is hitting API rate limits. Look for HTTP 429 responses in logs. If so, consider increasing `sync_interval_minutes` or implementing more aggressive backoff strategies.
    4.  **Document Size Limits:** Check if large documents are being skipped due to size limits (`max_attachment_size_mb`, `max_file_size_mb`).
    5.  **Incremental Sync Issues:** If using incremental sync, there might be issues with tracking the last sync timestamp. Try a full sync to see if more documents are retrieved.

## Search and Query Problems

### Problem: Search Returns No Results

*   **Symptoms:** Queries that should return results return empty result sets.
*   **Causes:** No documents have been indexed; search index is corrupted; query parsing issues; overly restrictive filters.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Check Document Count:** Verify that documents have been successfully indexed. Check the database or use an admin API to see the total number of indexed documents.
    2.  **Test Simple Queries:** Try very simple queries (e.g., single common words) to see if the search functionality is working at all.
    3.  **Check Filters:** If using filters in the query (sources, content types, date ranges), try removing them to see if they are overly restrictive.
    4.  **Reindex Documents:** If the search index might be corrupted, try triggering a full reindex of documents.
    5.  **Query Parsing:** Check logs for query parsing errors. The query might be malformed or contain unsupported syntax.

### Problem: Search Results Are Irrelevant

*   **Symptoms:** Search returns results, but they don't seem relevant to the query.
*   **Causes:** Poor relevance scoring; insufficient training data for ML models; issues with semantic search embeddings.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Check Relevance Algorithm:** Review the relevance scoring configuration. Ensure appropriate weights are given to different factors (title matches, content matches, metadata, etc.).
    2.  **Semantic Search Issues:** If using semantic search:
        *   Verify that embeddings are being generated correctly for both documents and queries.
        *   Check if the embedding model is appropriate for your content domain.
        *   Ensure the vector database is functioning correctly.
    3.  **Test Different Query Styles:** Try rephrasing queries or using different keywords to see if results improve.
    4.  **User Feedback:** Implement and encourage user feedback on search results to improve the system over time.

### Problem: Slow Search Performance

*   **Symptoms:** Queries take a long time to return results; timeouts occur.
*   **Causes:** Large document corpus; inefficient database queries; vector search performance issues; insufficient resources.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Database Performance:** Check database query performance. Look for slow queries in database logs. Ensure appropriate indexes are in place.
    2.  **Vector Search Optimization:** If using semantic search, ensure the vector database is properly configured and has sufficient resources.
    3.  **Caching:** Implement or tune caching for frequently accessed data and query results.
    4.  **Resource Scaling:** Consider scaling up the server resources (CPU, memory) or scaling out to multiple instances.
    5.  **Query Optimization:** Analyze slow queries and optimize them. Consider implementing query result pagination.

## AI/ML Feature Issues (Semantic Search, LLM)

### Problem: LLM (Large Language Model) Requests Fail

*   **Symptoms:** Queries that should use LLM for response generation fail; error messages about LLM API calls.
*   **Causes:** Invalid API key; LLM service is down; rate limiting; incorrect model configuration; network connectivity issues.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Verify API Key:** Ensure the LLM provider API key (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) is correct and has sufficient credits/quota.
    2.  **Test API Access:** Use `curl` to test the LLM API directly:
        ```bash
        curl -X POST "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions" \
             -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
             -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
             -d '{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]}'
        ```
    3.  **Check Model Names:** Ensure the model names in configuration (e.g., `ai_ml.models.query_understanding`) are correct and available from your LLM provider.
    4.  **Rate Limiting:** Check if you're hitting rate limits. Look for HTTP 429 responses. Consider implementing backoff strategies or upgrading your API plan.
    5.  **Service Status:** Check the LLM provider's status page (e.g., OpenAI Status) for any ongoing issues.

### Problem: Semantic Search Not Working

*   **Symptoms:** Semantic search features are disabled; search results don't seem to understand query intent; only keyword matching works.
*   **Causes:** Vector database not configured; embedding generation failing; semantic search disabled in configuration.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Check Configuration:** Ensure `ai_ml.semantic_search.enabled` is set to `true`.
    2.  **Vector Database:** Verify that the vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.) is properly configured and accessible.
    3.  **Embedding Generation:** Check if embeddings are being generated for documents and queries. Look for errors in embedding generation logs.
    4.  **Test Vector Database:** Test connectivity to the vector database directly using its native client or API.
    5.  **Embedding Model:** Ensure the embedding model (e.g., `text-embedding-ada-002`) is correctly specified and accessible.

### Problem: Poor Quality AI-Generated Responses

*   **Symptoms:** LLM-generated responses are irrelevant, inaccurate, or poorly formatted.
*   **Causes:** Inappropriate model selection; poor prompt engineering; insufficient context provided to the model; model limitations.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Model Selection:** Consider using a more capable model (e.g., GPT-4 instead of GPT-3.5) if available and within budget.
    2.  **Prompt Engineering:** Review and improve the prompts sent to the LLM. Ensure they provide clear instructions and sufficient context.
    3.  **Context Quality:** Ensure the document retrieval system is providing relevant and high-quality context to the LLM.
    4.  **Response Length:** Adjust `ai_ml.rag.max_response_tokens` to allow for more detailed responses if needed.
    5.  **Fine-tuning:** Consider fine-tuning models on your organization's specific content and terminology.

## Performance and Scalability Issues

### Problem: High CPU Usage

*   **Symptoms:** Server CPU usage consistently high; slow response times; system becomes unresponsive.
*   **Causes:** Inefficient algorithms; too many concurrent requests; resource-intensive operations (e.g., document processing, embedding generation).
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Identify CPU-Intensive Processes:** Use profiling tools to identify which parts of the application are consuming the most CPU.
    2.  **Optimize Algorithms:** Review and optimize any inefficient algorithms, especially in query processing and document matching.
    3.  **Asynchronous Processing:** Move CPU-intensive tasks (e.g., document indexing, embedding generation) to background workers.
    4.  **Scale Horizontally:** Add more application server instances and use a load balancer to distribute requests.
    5.  **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits and rate limiting to prevent any single user or process from overwhelming the system.

### Problem: High Memory Usage

*   **Symptoms:** Server memory usage grows over time; out-of-memory errors; application crashes.
*   **Causes:** Memory leaks; large datasets loaded into memory; inefficient caching; insufficient garbage collection.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Memory Profiling:** Use memory profiling tools to identify memory leaks or excessive memory usage.
    2.  **Optimize Caching:** Review caching strategies. Ensure caches have appropriate size limits and TTL settings.
    3.  **Database Connection Pooling:** Ensure database connection pools are properly configured and not leaking connections.
    4.  **Garbage Collection:** For languages like Python, ensure garbage collection is working properly and consider tuning GC settings.
    5.  **Scale Vertically:** Increase server memory if the usage is legitimate and within expected bounds.

### Problem: Database Performance Issues

*   **Symptoms:** Slow database queries; database connection timeouts; high database CPU/memory usage.
*   **Causes:** Missing indexes; inefficient queries; database server resource constraints; connection pool exhaustion.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Query Analysis:** Identify slow queries using database logs or monitoring tools. Analyze query execution plans.
    2.  **Indexing:** Ensure appropriate indexes are in place for frequently queried columns. Be careful not to over-index, as it can slow down writes.
    3.  **Connection Pooling:** Review database connection pool settings (`performance.database_connection_pool` in configuration). Ensure pool size is appropriate for your workload.
    4.  **Database Resources:** Monitor database server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O). Scale up if necessary.
    5.  **Query Optimization:** Rewrite inefficient queries. Consider using database-specific optimization techniques.

## Data Synchronization Failures

### Problem: Sync Jobs Fail to Start

*   **Symptoms:** Scheduled sync jobs don't run; no sync activity in logs.
*   **Causes:** Async task system (e.g., Celery) not running; message queue issues; sync disabled in configuration.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Check Async Task System:** Ensure Celery workers (or equivalent) are running. Check their logs for errors.
    2.  **Message Queue:** Verify that the message queue (RabbitMQ, Redis) is running and accessible.
    3.  **Sync Configuration:** Ensure `integrations.global_sync_enabled` is `true` and individual integrations have `enabled: true`.
    4.  **Scheduler:** If using a scheduler (e.g., cron, Celery Beat), ensure it's running and configured correctly.

### Problem: Sync Jobs Start but Fail

*   **Symptoms:** Sync jobs start but fail with errors; partial synchronization.
*   **Causes:** Authentication issues with source systems; network timeouts; API rate limiting; insufficient permissions; large documents causing timeouts.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Check Integration Logs:** Look for specific error messages in sync job logs.
    2.  **Authentication:** Verify that credentials for source systems are still valid and haven't expired.
    3.  **Network Issues:** Check for network connectivity problems between the KnowledgeOps server and source systems.
    4.  **Rate Limiting:** If hitting API rate limits, consider increasing sync intervals or implementing more sophisticated backoff strategies.
    5.  **Timeout Settings:** Increase timeout settings for sync operations if dealing with large documents or slow networks.
    6.  **Incremental vs Full Sync:** If incremental sync is failing, try a full sync to see if the issue is with change tracking.

### Problem: Documents Not Appearing in Search After Sync

*   **Symptoms:** Sync jobs complete successfully, but new or updated documents don't appear in search results.
*   **Causes:** Indexing pipeline issues; search index not updated; document processing failures.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Check Indexing Pipeline:** Verify that documents are being processed and indexed after sync. Check indexing logs.
    2.  **Search Index:** Ensure the search index (Elasticsearch, database) is being updated. Check index statistics.
    3.  **Document Processing:** Look for errors in document content extraction or embedding generation.
    4.  **Cache Issues:** Clear relevant caches that might be serving stale search results.
    5.  **Manual Reindex:** Try manually triggering a reindex of recently synced documents.

## API Usage Errors

### Problem: HTTP 400 Bad Request Errors

*   **Symptoms:** API requests return 400 status codes with error messages about invalid requests.
*   **Causes:** Malformed JSON in request body; missing required parameters; invalid parameter values; incorrect Content-Type header.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Validate JSON:** Ensure request bodies contain valid JSON. Use a JSON validator.
    2.  **Check Required Parameters:** Review the [API Documentation](./API.md) to ensure all required parameters are included.
    3.  **Parameter Values:** Verify that parameter values are of the correct type and within valid ranges.
    4.  **Headers:** Ensure the `Content-Type: application/json` header is included for requests with JSON bodies.
    5.  **API Version:** Ensure you're using the correct API version in the URL path.

### Problem: HTTP 429 Rate Limit Exceeded

*   **Symptoms:** API requests return 429 status codes; "Rate limit exceeded" error messages.
*   **Causes:** Too many requests in a short time period; rate limits configured too low for your use case.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Implement Backoff:** Implement exponential backoff in your client code. Respect the `Retry-After` header in 429 responses.
    2.  **Review Rate Limits:** Check the rate limiting configuration (`performance.rate_limiting` in config) and adjust if necessary.
    3.  **Optimize Request Patterns:** Reduce the frequency of requests if possible. Batch operations where supported.
    4.  **Upgrade Plan:** If using a hosted service, consider upgrading to a plan with higher rate limits.

### Problem: HTTP 500 Internal Server Error

*   **Symptoms:** API requests return 500 status codes; generic "Internal Server Error" messages.
*   **Causes:** Unhandled exceptions in application code; database connectivity issues; external service failures.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Check Application Logs:** Look for stack traces and error messages in application logs around the time of the 500 error.
    2.  **Database Connectivity:** Ensure the database is accessible and not experiencing issues.
    3.  **External Dependencies:** Check if external services (LLM providers, vector databases) are operational.
    4.  **Resource Exhaustion:** Verify that the server has sufficient resources (CPU, memory, disk space).
    5.  **Recent Changes:** Consider if any recent code deployments or configuration changes might have introduced the issue.

## Logging and Monitoring Issues

### Problem: No Logs Being Generated

*   **Symptoms:** Log files are empty or not being created; no log output to console.
*   **Causes:** Logging disabled; incorrect log file path; insufficient permissions to write log files; logging configuration errors.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Check Logging Configuration:** Verify `logging.level` and `logging.output_target` in configuration.
    2.  **File Permissions:** Ensure the application has write permissions to the log file directory.
    3.  **Log File Path:** Verify that the log file path (`logging.file.path`) is correct and the directory exists.
    4.  **Environment Variable Override:** Check if `KNOWLEDGEOPS_LOG_LEVEL` is set to a level that would suppress logs.
    5.  **Test Logging:** Temporarily set log level to `DEBUG` and output to `console` to see if logging works at all.

### Problem: Excessive Log Volume

*   **Symptoms:** Log files grow very large quickly; disk space issues; performance impact from logging.
*   **Causes:** Log level set too low (e.g., DEBUG in production); verbose third-party libraries; log rotation not configured.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Adjust Log Level:** Set log level to `INFO` or `WARNING` in production. Use `DEBUG` only for troubleshooting.
    2.  **Module-Specific Levels:** Use `logging.module_log_levels` to set higher log levels for verbose libraries.
    3.  **Log Rotation:** Configure log rotation (`logging.file.max_size_mb`, `logging.file.backup_count`) to prevent log files from growing indefinitely.
    4.  **Log Filtering:** Implement log filtering to exclude noisy but unimportant log messages.

### Problem: Monitoring Metrics Not Available

*   **Symptoms:** Prometheus metrics endpoint returns 404; monitoring dashboards show no data.
*   **Causes:** Prometheus metrics disabled; metrics endpoint not exposed; firewall blocking metrics port.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Enable Metrics:** Ensure `monitoring.prometheus_enabled` is set to `true` in configuration.
    2.  **Check Metrics Endpoint:** Try accessing the metrics endpoint directly (usually `/metrics` on the main port or a separate port).
    3.  **Firewall/Network:** Ensure the metrics port is accessible from your monitoring system.
    4.  **Prometheus Configuration:** Verify that your Prometheus server is configured to scrape the KnowledgeOps metrics endpoint.

## Webhook and Notification Failures

### Problem: Webhooks Not Being Delivered

*   **Symptoms:** External systems not receiving webhook notifications; webhook delivery logs show failures.
*   **Causes:** Incorrect webhook URL; network connectivity issues; receiving system down; authentication failures.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Verify Webhook URL:** Ensure the webhook URL is correct and accessible from the KnowledgeOps server.
    2.  **Test Connectivity:** Use `curl` to test connectivity to the webhook endpoint:
        ```bash
        curl -X POST <WEBHOOK_URL> -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"test": "message"}'
        ```
    3.  **Check Webhook Logs:** Look for specific error messages in webhook delivery logs.
    4.  **Authentication:** If the webhook endpoint requires authentication, ensure the correct credentials or signatures are being used.
    5.  **Retry Configuration:** Check webhook retry settings and adjust if necessary.

### Problem: Email Notifications Not Sent

*   **Symptoms:** Users not receiving email notifications; email sending errors in logs.
*   **Causes:** SMTP server configuration issues; authentication problems; network connectivity; email blocked by spam filters.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **SMTP Configuration:** Verify SMTP server settings (`notifications.email` in configuration).
    2.  **Test SMTP Connection:** Use a tool like `telnet` or `openssl s_client` to test connectivity to the SMTP server.
    3.  **Authentication:** Ensure SMTP username and password are correct.
    4.  **Email Content:** Check if emails are being flagged as spam. Review email content and sender reputation.
    5.  **Email Logs:** Check both application logs and SMTP server logs for error messages.

## Advanced Debugging Techniques

### Enabling Debug Mode

For complex issues, enable debug mode to get more detailed information:

1.  **Set Log Level:** `KNOWLEDGEOPS_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`
2.  **Enable Component Debugging:** In `config.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    advanced:
      component_debugging:
        query_parser_debug_mode: true
        sync_job_verbose_logging: true
    ```
3.  **Database Query Logging:** Enable SQLAlchemy query logging:
    ```yaml
    advanced:
      library_tuning:
        sqlalchemy:
          echo: true
    ```

### Using Application Profiling

For performance issues, use profiling tools:

1.  **Python Profiling:** Use `cProfile` or `py-spy` to profile the application.
2.  **Memory Profiling:** Use `memory_profiler` or `tracemalloc` to identify memory leaks.
3.  **Database Profiling:** Use database-specific tools to analyze query performance.

### Network Debugging

For connectivity issues:

1.  **Packet Capture:** Use `tcpdump` or `wireshark` to capture network traffic.
2.  **DNS Resolution:** Use `nslookup` or `dig` to verify DNS resolution.
3.  **SSL/TLS Issues:** Use `openssl s_client` to test SSL connections.

### Container Debugging

For Docker-related issues:

1.  **Container Logs:** `docker logs <container_name>`
2.  **Container Shell:** `docker exec -it <container_name> /bin/bash`
3.  **Resource Usage:** `docker stats`
4.  **Network Inspection:** `docker network ls` and `docker network inspect`
