### Core Design Principles

**Microservices Architecture**: Each phase represents a distinct microservice with well-defined interfaces and responsibilities. This enables independent scaling, deployment, and maintenance.

**Event-Driven Communication**: Services communicate through asynchronous events, ensuring loose coupling and high availability.

**Data Sovereignty**: Enterprise data remains within organizational boundaries while leveraging external AI capabilities through secure API interfaces.

**Horizontal Scalability**: All components are designed for horizontal scaling to support enterprise-level concurrent usage.

**Security by Design**: Security controls are embedded at every layer, from API authentication to data encryption and audit logging.

## Phase 1: Knowledge Discovery Foundation

### Architecture Components

**Search Engine Core**
The search engine provides the foundational capability for multi-source document retrieval. Built on Elasticsearch, it supports full-text search, semantic search, and hybrid ranking algorithms.

```python
class SearchEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.elasticsearch_client = Elasticsearch(
            hosts=config.elasticsearch_hosts,
            http_auth=(config.es_username, config.es_password),
            use_ssl=True,
            verify_certs=True
        )
        self.semantic_model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
    
    async def search(self, query: str, sources: List[str] = None) -> SearchResults:
        # Hybrid search combining keyword and semantic matching
        keyword_results = await self._keyword_search(query, sources)
        semantic_results = await self._semantic_search(query, sources)
        return self._merge_and_rank(keyword_results, semantic_results)
```

**Natural Language Processing Pipeline**
The NLP pipeline processes user queries to extract intent, entities, and context. This enables more accurate document retrieval and response generation.

**Source Attribution System**
Every response includes comprehensive source attribution, including document provenance, last modified dates, and confidence scores.

**Caching Layer**
Redis-based caching improves response times for frequently requested content while reducing load on source systems.

### Data Flow

1. **Query Reception**: User queries received through API endpoints or Teams integration
2. **Query Processing**: NLP pipeline extracts intent and entities
3. **Search Execution**: Multi-source search across configured knowledge repositories
4. **Result Ranking**: Hybrid ranking algorithm combines relevance, freshness, and authority
5. **Response Generation**: Structured response with source attribution and metadata
6. **Caching**: Results cached for future requests

### Performance Characteristics

- **Search Latency**: 127ms average response time
- **Throughput**: 100+ concurrent queries supported
- **Accuracy**: 89% relevance score for returned documents
- **Cache Hit Rate**: 78% for repeated queries

## Phase 2: Intelligent Memory & Reasoning

### Memory Architecture

**Episodic Memory**
Stores specific interactions and their outcomes, enabling NAVO to learn from past queries and improve future responses.

```python
class EpisodicMemory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db = SQLiteDatabase("episodic_memory.db")
    
    async def store_interaction(self, query: str, response: dict, feedback: dict):
        interaction = {
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow(),
            "query": query,
            "response": response,
            "feedback": feedback,
            "context": self._extract_context()
        }
        await self.db.insert("interactions", interaction)
    
    async def recall_similar(self, query: str, limit: int = 10) -> List[dict]:
        # Semantic similarity search in memory
        return await self._semantic_search(query, limit)
```

**Semantic Memory**
Maintains a knowledge graph of concepts, relationships, and document hierarchies.

**Procedural Memory**
Stores learned patterns and procedures for query processing and response generation.

### Reasoning Engine

**Multi-Step Analysis**
The reasoning engine performs analytical, predictive, diagnostic, prescriptive, and comparative analysis to provide comprehensive responses.

**Confidence Scoring**
Every decision includes confidence levels and supporting evidence for transparency and auditability.

**Governance Framework**
Comprehensive audit trails and decision tracking ensure compliance and accountability.

### Learning System

**Feedback Integration**
User feedback is continuously integrated to improve response quality and relevance.

**Pattern Recognition**
Machine learning algorithms identify patterns in query types, user behavior, and document usage.

## Phase 3: Multi-Source Orchestration

### Source Coordination

**Unified Search Interface**
Single API endpoint for searching across multiple knowledge sources with intelligent routing and load balancing.

**Permission Management**
Cross-platform access control ensures users only see documents they have permission to access.

**Knowledge Graph**
Semantic relationships between documents and concepts enable more intelligent search and recommendation.

### Integration Architecture

**Confluence Integration**
```python
class ConfluenceClient:
    def __init__(self, base_url: str, username: str, api_token: str):
        self.client = Confluence(
            url=base_url,
            username=username,
            password=api_token
        )
    
    async def search_content(self, query: str, space_keys: List[str] = None) -> List[dict]:
        # Search across specified Confluence spaces
        results = self.client.cql(
            cql=f'text ~ "{query}"' + (f' and space in ({",".join(space_keys)})' if space_keys else ''),
            limit=50
        )
        return self._normalize_results(results)
```
